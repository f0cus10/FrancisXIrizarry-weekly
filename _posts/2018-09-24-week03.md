## Assignment 4/5:

# Exploration of Git and Application of such

* Part 1:  
  Git is a powerful tool in terms of managing versions of software. It has become an integral part of github, and various other websites because of it's verbose usages and functionality. The chapters given were focused on exploring the basics of git, how tagging, forking, pulling, pushing, and various important techniques existed, and how to use them. Of the various basics brought up I believe Undoing a commit, and how to commit were two of the most important because of the impact they could have on a established system, and creating a new system. Very few times I have had an issue where I needed to undo a commit to a project I had uploaded using git; however, there were a couple of times where this information was necessary but thankfully there were various websites where people had discussed the issues I was having, and adding to a repository is always a required step. 

* Part 2:
  Completed github test assignment which was to fork a project, and return code to be merged. It was relatively painless and useful.
