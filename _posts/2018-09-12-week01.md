## First weekly blog

Not much information need be said here currently. There were a few locations that I noticed that were not updated. I considered adding a few extra details; however, without an exact position I felt that it was not a smart decision; therefore, until I visit those spots again with my phone I will leave the other spots as they are. Additionally it seems that they also don't have much information regarding smaller stores in this area, nor do they realize there are some food joints nearby. Editations will be made regarding this tomorrow.
